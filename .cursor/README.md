# Cursor Configuration

This directory contains Cursor-specific configuration and rule files for the project.

## Files

- **`code-quality-rules.md`** - Comprehensive coding standards and patterns based on the actual codebase structure. This file documents:
  - Project structure and organization
  - TypeScript standards and type safety
  - Component patterns (Server/Client components)
  - Error handling patterns
  - Database patterns (Prisma)
  - Server actions
  - Styling patterns (Tailwind CSS)
  - State management
  - Authentication patterns
  - Code quality best practices

## Usage

These rules are intended to guide code development and maintain consistency across the codebase. They reflect the actual patterns and conventions used throughout the project.

## Note

If Cursor requires a `.cursorrules` file in the project root, you may need to create a symlink or reference file pointing to this directory.
